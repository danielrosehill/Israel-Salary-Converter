This Streamlit utility converts between Israeli salaries and world salaries. 

In Israel, besides being denominated in New Israeli Shekels (NIS), salaries are usually stated in monthly amounts. 

In order to convert between world salaries and Israeli salaries, multiplication or division by 12 is usually necessary, as well as the currency conversion. 

This application uses a simple slider interface to drag between the Israeli salary and the world salaries. On the World to Israel tab you can choose between one of the 3 supported world currencies USD Euro and GBP and use the slider in the other direction..
